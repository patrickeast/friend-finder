# Friend Finder Application

Friend Finder is an interactive web application using Node and Express servers. The application takes in users' input from a series of questions on a scale of 1 to 5, scores the absolute value of the input, and then compares the score to the absolute value of pre-existing profiles' scores to find the closest match.

#Version 2.0
In the future, I would like to add a database to this so that user profiles and uploaded images can be saved, instead of comparing results to pre-existing "dummy" profiles. I also want to implement Handlebars to make this a lot smoother.
